The portfolio I am submitting was partially made beforehand. Specifically, the main logo, the nav bar, and the reactive scaling of the website. To pass validation checks, I changed certain elements. One of these elements was the nav bar which was beforehand an unordered list, and is now an ordered list. Another of these changes was the addition of correct alt text for content. Last of the primary changes for validation checks was changing how I was using headings, changing from using headings as a makeshift bold and instead properly using CSS to do so, and using headings as they are intended for accessibility users. 

In order to improve the previous website, I added a footer, and cleaned up the css file by using variables. In order to meet requirements in the assignment, I replaced what was previously unicode text electrical symbols with Google Material Icons. 

I looked through the potential issues section, but almost all of them were not issues. One issue I ran into was about alt text on a logo image, there were warnings that said to give it alt text, but also warning that said such aesthetic or structural images don't need an alt description.
